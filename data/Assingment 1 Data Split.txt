### Assingment 1
Take any data set and perform a data shuffle and split the data into two parts (90/10 split for training/testing).

### Solution

a = load 'dataset' using PigStorage(',');
a = foreach a generate RANDOM(), *;

split a into training if $0 <= 0.9, test if $0 > 0.9;

training = group training all;
training = foreach training generate flatten($1);
training = foreach training generate $1 ..;

test = group test all;
test = foreach test generate flatten($1);
test = foreach test generate $1 ..;

store training into 'training' using PigStorage(',');
store test into 'test' using PigStorage(',');


Notes 
Project-Range Expressions
Project-range ( .. ) expressions can be used to project a range of columns from input. For example:

.. $x : projects columns $0 through $x, inclusive

$x .. : projects columns through end, inclusive

$x .. $y : projects columns through $y, inclusive
